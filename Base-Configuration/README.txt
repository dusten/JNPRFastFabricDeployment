The first topology is built from:

Figure 1 with 3 spines and 5 leafs.

Here is video around the use of the automation and how I build it. https://youtu.be/yuXpycsW48Q

I built the other topologies but they are in other sections that I will add as I get more time. 

I used the commands right on the bottom of that webpage with the exception of the multi-home/LACP commands. I was super focused on load-balancing and failover for this part.

So the odd numbers (3 spines/5 leafs) reflect my choice not to deploy multi-homing in the first round.
