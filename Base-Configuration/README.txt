The first topology is built from: 
https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/junos/topics/example/evpn-vxlan-qfx5110-l3-vxlan-gateway-collapsed.html
Figure 1 with 3 spines and 5 leafs.

I built the other topologies but they are in other sections that I will add as I get more time. I used the commands below with the exception of the multi-home/LACP commands. I was super focused on load-balancing and failover for this part.So the odd numbers reflect my choice not to deploy multi-homing in the first round.
